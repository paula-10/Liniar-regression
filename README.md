Linear regression is a Machine Learning technique that produces a line that best fits among these points, such that the sum of the distances between the points and the 
drawn line is minimal. For 2 axes (x and y), a linear regression consists of a line described by the equation y = ax + b, where a and b are constants that need to be
determined by you to minimize the distance between the points and the line.
We will call the coordinates on the x-axis of the points in the picture below the input. The value on the y-axis of each point will be called the actual value. Additionally, the 
y(x) values on the determined line will be called predictions. 
With this taxonomy, we can say that linear regression estimates a line such that the sum of all prediction errors (the difference between the predicted value and the 
actual value) is minimal.
